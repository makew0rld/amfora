###### Recording of v1.0.0

Amfora aims to be the best looking [Gemini](https://gemini.circumlunar.space/) client with the most features... all in the terminal. It does not support Gopher or other non-Web protocols - check out [Bombadillo](http://bombadillo.colorfield.space/) for that.

It also aims to be completely cross platform, with full Windows support. If you're on Windows, I would not recommend using the default terminal software. Use [Windows Terminal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk701) instead, and make sure it [works with UTF-8](https://akr.am/blog/posts/using-utf-8-in-the-windows-terminal). Note that some of the application colors might not display correctly on Windows, but all functionality will still work.

It fully passes Sean Conman's client torture test, as well as the Egsam one.

## Installation

### Binary

Download a binary from the [releases](https://github.com/makeworld-the-better-one/amfora/releases) page. On Unix-based systems you will have to make the file executable with `chmod +x <filename>`. You can rename the file to just `amfora` for easy access, and move it to `/usr/local/bin/`.

On Windows, make sure you click "Advanced > Run anyway" after double-clicking, or something like that.

Unix systems can install the desktop entry file to get Amfora to appear when they search for applications:
```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/makeworld-the-better-one/amfora/master/amfora.desktop -o ~/.local/share/applications/amfora.desktop
update-desktop-database ~/.local/share/applications
```

Make sure to click "Watch" in the top right, then "Custom" > "Releases" to get notified about new releases!


### Arch Linux

Arch Linux users can install Amfora using pacman.

```
sudo pacman -S amfora
```

```

brew install amfora
```
You can update it with:

### From Source

This section is for advanced users who want to install the latest (possibly unstable) version of Amfora.

<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

**Requirements:**
- Go 1.13 or later
- GNU Make

Please note the Makefile does not intend to support Windows, and so there may be issues.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/makeworld-the-better-one/amfora
cd amfora
# git checkout v1.2.3 # Optionally pin to a specific version instead of the latest commit
make # Might be gmake on macOS
sudo make install # If you want to install the binary for all users
```

Because you installed with the Makefile, running `amfora -v` will tell you exactly what commit the binary was built from.

MacOS users can also use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to install the latest commit of Amfora:

```
brew tap makeworld-the-better-one/tap
brew install --HEAD amfora
```
You can update it with:
```
brew upgrade --fetch-HEAD amfora
```
