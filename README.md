###### Recording of v1.0.0

Amfora aims to be the best looking [Gemini](https://gemini.circumlunar.space/) client with the most features... all in the terminal. It does not support Gopher or other non-Web protocols - check out [Bombadillo](http://bombadillo.colorfield.space/) for that.

It also aims to be completely cross platform, with full Windows support. If you're on Windows, I would not recommend using the default terminal software. Use [Windows Terminal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk701) instead, and make sure it [works with UTF-8](https://akr.am/blog/posts/using-utf-8-in-the-windows-terminal). Note that some of the application colors might not display correctly on Windows, but all functionality will still work.

It fully passes Sean Conman's client torture test, including the new Unicode tests. It mostly passes the Egsam test.

## Installation

### Binary

Download a binary from the [releases](https://github.com/makeworld-the-better-one/amfora/releases) page. On Unix-based systems you might have to make the file executable with `chmod +x <filename>`. You can rename the file to just `amfora` for easy access, and move it to `/usr/local/bin/`.

On Windows, make sure you click "Advanced > Run anyway" after double-clicking, or something like that.

Unix systems can install the desktop entry file to get Amfora to appear when they search for applications:
```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/makeworld-the-better-one/amfora/master/amfora.desktop -o ~/.local/share/applications/amfora.desktop
update-desktop-database ~/.local/share/applications
```

Make sure to click "Watch" > "Releases only" in the top right to get notified about new releases!


### Arch Linux

Arch Linux users can install Amfora using pacman.

```
sudo pacman -S amfora
```

### Homebrew

If you use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), you can install Amfora through the official tap.
```
brew tap makeworld-the-better-one/tap
brew install amfora
```
You can update it with:
```
brew upgrade amfora
```

### From Source
This section is for advanced users who want to install the latest (possibly unstable) version of Amfora.

**Requirements:**
- Go 1.13 or later
- GNU Make

Please note the Makefile does not intend to support Windows, and so there may be issues.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/makeworld-the-better-one/amfora
cd amfora
# git checkout v1.2.3 # Optionally pin to a specific version instead of the latest commit
make # Might be gmake on macOS
sudo make install # If you want to install the binary for all users
```

Because you installed with the Makefile, running `amfora -v` will tell you exactly what commit the binary was built from.

MacOS users can also use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to install the latest commit of Amfora:

```
brew tap makeworld-the-better-one/tap
brew install --HEAD amfora
```
You can update it with:
```
brew upgrade --fetch-HEAD amfora
```

## Usage

Just call `amfora` or `amfora <url>` on the terminal. On Windows it might be `amfora.exe` instead.

To determine the version, you can run `amfora --version` or `amfora -v`.

The project keeps many standard terminal keybindings and is intuitive. Press <kbd>?</kbd> inside the application to pull up the help menu with a list of all the keybindings, and <kbd>Esc</kbd> to leave it. If you have used Bombadillo you will find it similar.

It is designed with large terminals in mind, but should look and work well at any reasonable terminal size.

It was tested with left-to-right languages, and will likely not work as well with right-to-left languages like Arabic.

- [ ] Search in pages with <kbd>Ctrl-F</kbd>
- [ ] Support Markdown rendering
- [ ] History browser

## Configuration
The config file is written in the intuitive [TOML](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml) file format. See [default-config.toml](./default-config.toml) for details. By default this file is available at `~/.config/amfora/config.toml`, or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/amfora/config.toml`, if that variable is set.

On Windows, the file is in `%APPDATA%\amfora\config.toml`, which usually expands to `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\amfora\config.toml`.

## Client Certificates

Amfora has early support for client certs. Eventually Amfora will be able to generate them itself, but for you can do it by using OpenSSL:

```shell
openssl req -new -subj "/CN=username" -x509 -newkey ec -pkeyopt ec_paramgen_curve:prime256v1 -days 1825 -nodes -out cert.pem -keyout key.pem
```

This will create a certificate and key file, that can be renamed and moved as you like. See the configuration section above for how to edit your config file to tell Amfora about them.

## Known Bugs

- Pasting on Windows is truncated, the full paste content won't be added. ([#43](https://github.com/makeworld-the-better-one/amfora/issues/43))
