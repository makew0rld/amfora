# gemini-wiki

This folder contains a Python script that downloads the Amfora [wiki](https://github.com/makeworld-the-better-one/amfora/wiki)
and converts it to gemtext, incorporating the sidebar and footer as well.

The script expects to be run inside the folder where the Gemini version of the wiki should be.

The output of this script can be viewed at `gemini://makeworld.gq/amfora-wiki/`.
