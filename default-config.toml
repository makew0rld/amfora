# If a command is set, than the URL will be added (in quotes) to the end of the command.
# A space will be prepended to the URL.
#
# The best to define a command is using a string array.
# Examples:
# http = ['firefox']
# http = ['custom-browser', '--flag', '--option=2']
# http = ['/path/with spaces/in it/firefox']
#
# Note the use of single quotes, so that backslashes will not be escaped.
# Using just a string will also work, but it is deprecated, and will degrade if
# you use paths with spaces.

[url-handlers]

[proxies]
# Allows setting a Gemini proxy for different schemes.

# E.g. to open a gopher page by connecting to a Gemini proxy server:
#   gopher = "example.com:123"
#
# Port 1965 is assumed if no port is specified.

# If you want to stick to the standard 16 or 256 colors, you can get
# a list of those here: https://jonasjacek.github.io/colors/
