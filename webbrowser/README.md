# `package webbrowser`

The code in this folder is adapted from Bombadillo, you can see the original [here](https://tildegit.org/sloum/bombadillo/src/branch/master/http). Many thanks to Sloum and the rest of the team!

The code is simple, and I have changed it, but in any case there should be no licensing issues because both repos are under GPL v3.
